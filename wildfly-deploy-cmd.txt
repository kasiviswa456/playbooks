Deployment in wildfly has two methods.

1. console
2. cmd line



Deploying war through cmd line has three methods

1.....interactive mode.
2.....non-interactive mode.
3.....copy war file to deployments directory.



To deploy a war file to wildfly in interactive mode...
 
./jboss-cli.sh -c   =  to login into interactive mode..

delpoy warfilepath = to delpoy war in interactive mode.

deployment-info = to see the all successful deployments.

undeploy warfilename  =  to undeploy war..
 
 
 

To deploy war to wildfly in non-interactive mode....
 
 
/opt/wildfly-9.0.2.Final/bin/jboss-cli.sh -c controller=ip:9990 --user=username --password=password --command="deploy /root/RED/sample.war" 



you can also copy the war file to standalone/deployments directory to deploy application..

it will copy the war file to that path....
